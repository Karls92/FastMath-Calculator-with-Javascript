# FastMath Calculator

This project consists in a sample Math calculator built with vanilla Javascript, HTML5 and CSS. 
This calculator can only work with the basic math operations (sum, minus, product, divide). 

## Â¿How do you test the FastMath Calculator in your Local Machine?

 #### You have two ways to do it:
 
 1. You can clone this repository in your local machine. (Don't you know how to do it? check this tutorial: https://docs.github.com/es/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
 2. or Download the repository as a .zip file, unzip it anywhere on your computer.
 
 Once it's done, go to the project folder and launch a local development server.
 (if you don't know how to do it, I recommend you open the project in VS Code editor and use the "Live server" extension to launch a local server easily
 
 When the local server is running, go to your browser, insert the url where the project is running and then you will see the FastMath calculator working.
